# What is Innovise?
Innovise is a community-driven website for computer science students to find new connections and opportunities. It allows for sharing of ideas and finding and exploring new horizons. We aim to provide this via enabling users to share their thoughts by way of posts and interests and carefully curating their user experience to enable users to get the most relevant content for themselves. Innovise can also serve as the starting point for job and internship hunts all thanks to our active and friendly community.

# Tech Stack
The frontend uses the React library in combination with the React Router library to make a SPA frontend for the Innovise project. Styling has been done using bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, and component/icon libraries like Antd and Material UI. Axios has been used to connect and consume API calls to the backend.
